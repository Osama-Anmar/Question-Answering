# Question-Answering
This repository contains a project focused on implementing and evaluating a Question-Answering (QA) system using deep learning models. The goal of this project is to develop a model that can answer questions based on a given question.

# Overview
The project leverages sequence models like LSTMs (Long Short-Term Memory networks), answer the question. This project focus on encoder-decoder model with and without attention mechanisms.

# Preprocessing
Preprocessing steps include:

* Tokenization: Splitting text into tokens or words.
* Text Normalization: Converting text to lowercase, removing special characters, etc.
* Sequence Padding: Ensuring that all input sequences are of the same length.
 
# Model
Several models have been explored for text generation, including:

* LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
